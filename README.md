# 🏏 IPL Analytics Dashboard (2008–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Indian Premier League (IPL)** is one of the most competitive and data-rich T20 cricket leagues in the world. With over a decade of matches, evolving team strategies, and player performances across venues and seasons, the IPL provides an excellent opportunity for **data-driven analysis**.

This project is an **interactive IPL Analytics Dashboard** built using **Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit**, designed to explore **match-level and ball-by-ball data from 2008 to 2024**. The dashboard enables users to analyze **league-wide trends, team performance, and player insights** through dynamic filters and interactive visualizations.
